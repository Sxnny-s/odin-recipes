<h2>Decription</h2>
<p>This egg noodle recipe is basic and old-fashioned, just like grammy used to make! Try them next time you prepare your favorite soup or stew. Don't forget that fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried! You may use a dough hook attachment on your electric mixer or your hands to knead the pasta dough.</p>
